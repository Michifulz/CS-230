    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
the Gaming Room client was a company to expanded their software to other operating systems. The soft wear being developed is called "Draw It or Lose It", a multiuser game based on a 1980s television game. 

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
During this development documentation, the processes of research went well, there was plenty of information about the systems that the client was interested in. 

    What about the process of working through a design document did you found helpful when developing the code?
I thought it was particularly helpful to have the UML diagram as well as the knowledge of how to use it. This information made creating code for this project go more smoothly. 

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would spend more time with maven/dropwizard project. I would work to fully understand why I was getting errors and issues with it and I would like to feel more comfortable importing as well. 

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's need by ensuring that the prompts were correctly written. It's important to consider the user's needs because the user is directly interacting with the soft wear, their needs will impact how they feel and if they choose to keep utilizing the soft wear. 


    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software by taking things one step at a time. Using the UML diagram provided to work through and ensure all parts were correctly included. When working with similar software in the future I will use the same strategy.
